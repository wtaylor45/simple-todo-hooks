This very small project's goal was to give me a chance to try out the basics of React's hook system. 
I intend to increment on it to see if I can continue to learn through this.

## What is this?
This is **another** ReactJS todo app! This uses hooks though. So.

## How do I run this bad boy?
- Clone this repository
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`

## But why?
Again, just a small project to get my hands on React hooks!
